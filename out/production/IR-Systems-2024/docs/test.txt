Support towards the Europe PMC initiative-Contribution for 2014-2016: "The proposed action will provide continued support to the European Research Council (ERC) in the implementation of its Open Access strategy for projects funded in the Life Sciences domain. It follows on from the project ""Support towards the Europe PMC initiative-Contribution for 2013""(ERC-EuropePMC-SUP-2013) which has allowed the ERC to offer the benefits of Europe PMC to its funded researchers for the first time in 2013. The ERC Open Access strategy, and how the present project will assist the ERC in its implementation, is explained below"

Support to the Vice-Presidents of the ERC Scientific Council 2014: The proposed Action will provide the necessary support to the Vice-Presidents of the European Research Council Scientific Council (ERC ScC) to achieve key milestones and deliverables of the ScC, which are required in the first year of implementation under the Horizon 2020 framework programme.
Under the Horizon 2020 programme, the Commission has established the European Research Council providing a competitive funding mechanism for investigator-driven frontier research on European level. One of the key structural components of the ERC is the Scientific Council consisting of 22 eminent researchers, representative of a large range of disciplines and institutional backgrounds. The ERC ScC independently establishes and oversees the ERC's scientific management and the implementation of the Work Programme, including the peer review and the selection of peer reviewers.
The three Vice-Presidents of the ERCâ€™s ScC, in their diverse responsibilities which include the achievement of efficient and effective functioning of the ScC, its integrated operation together with the ERC Executive Agency (ERCEA), and effective interfacing with the scientific community, other funding agencies and the political institutions of the European Union. The project will provide administrative and research support ranging from secretarial tasks to assistance in developing policy papers related to the work of the Vice-Presidents of the ERC ScC for a period of one year.
The potential impact of the project will be to ensure an efficient and well-managed operation of the ERC ScC. By providing high-level local support for the Vice-Presidents, the project will complement the activities of and allow efficient interfacing with the ERCEA. The proposed support is required as the duties of the Vice-Presidents demand a considerable part of their time. Overall, the project is expected to contribute significantly to the implementation of the ERC under Horizon 2020.

Implementation of activities described in the Roadmap to Fusion during Horizon 2020 through a Joint programme of the members of the EUROfusion consortium: A Roadmap to the realization of fusion energy was adopted by the EFDA system at the end of 2012. The roadmap aims at achieving all the necessary know-how to start the construction of a demonstration power plant (DEMO) by 2030, in order to reach the goal of fusion electricity in the grid by 2050. The roadmap has been articulated in eight different Missions. The present proposal has the goal of implementing the activities described in the Roadmap during Horizon 2020 through a joint programme of the members of the EUROfusion Consortium.
ITER is the key facility in the roadmap. Thus, ITER success remains the most important overarching objective of the programme and, in the present proposal the vast majority of resources in Horizon 2020 are devoted to ensure that ITER is built within scope, time and budget; its operation is properly prepared; and a new generation of scientists and engineers is properly educated (at undergraduate and PhD level) and trained (at postdoctoral level) for its exploitation. DEMO is the only step between ITER and a commercial fusion power plant. To achieve the goal of fusion electricity demonstration by 2050, DEMO construction has to begin in the early 2030s at the latest, to allow the start of operation in the early 2040s. DEMO cannot be defined and designed by research laboratories alone, but requires the full involvement of industry in all technological and systems aspects of the design. Specific provisions for the involvement of industry in the Consortium activities are envisaged.
